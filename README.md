# PHP8 Argon2 extension with extended functions

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD-orange.svg?style=flat-square "License")](https://github.com/moaminsharifi/php-argon2-ext/blob/master/LICENSE.md)


This PHP extension provides a simplified interface to the [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) algorithm, the winner of the [Password Hashing Competition](https://password-hashing.net/). Argon2 is considered the successor to bcrypt/scrypt/pbkdf methods of securely hashing passwords. This project is in no way associated with or endorsed by the PHC team.

> This extension is compatible with PHP 8, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3. It CANNOT WORK in PHP 8.4 because the required `ext/standard/php_random.h` file has been removed from the PHP source. To use this extension with PHP 8.4, you would need to manually modify the extension or provide the missing file.

## Building

```bash
# Clone the extension and the Argon2 Submodule
git clone --recursive https://github.com/moaminsharifi/php-argon2-ext
cd php-argon2-ext

# Build the Argon2 library
cd ext/argon2
CFLAGS="-fPIC" make -j1 OPTTARGET=i686
make test

# Remove the argon2 shared library to force Argon2 to be compiled statically into the extension
rm libargon2.so.1
cd ../..

# Build the extension
phpize
./configure --with-argon2
make
```

### Installation

Once you have compiled the extension, you can install it via `make install`, adding the extension to your `php.ini` file or to a file in your loaded extensions directory,

```bash
$ sudo make install
# Load the extension to your php.ini/php conf.d
# echo "extension=argon2.so" > /path/to/php.ini
```

### Testing

Extension is tested through `make test`. You are strongly encouraged to run the tests to make sure everything was built correctly. A summary of the tests will be outlined

```bash
$ make test
```

If `make test` encounters an error, please provide a copy of the error report as a Github issue.

## Usage

### Constants

The following constants are exposed for determining which Argon2 algorithm you wish to use:

```php
HASH_ARGON2ID
HASH_ARGON2I
HASH_ARGON2D
```

The constant `HASH_ARGON2ID` can also be aliased by `HASH_ARGON2`.

> These constants are named to avoid conflicts with https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1997, which would implement Argon2 in PHP Core.

### Hash Generation
```php
argon2_hash(string $string, string $salt [, const $algorithm = HASH_ARGON2ID] [, array $options ] [, bool $raw = false ]);
```

Hashes can be generated by running `argon2_hash()` with the string you want to see hashed and a salt value. Without any additional arguments, the hash generated will have the following options. These defaults are based upon the Argon2 specification as good minimums. You are encouraged to run `make bench` against the `ext/argon2` to determine what are good defaults for your system.

```bash
algorithm = HASH_ARGON2ID
options = [
    m_cost: 1<<16
    t_cost: 3
    threads: 1
]
```

> This function requires you to provide your own cryptographically secure salt. It is recommended to use `random_bytes()` to generate a sufficiently secure salt.

#### Example with Salt

```php
// Generate a secure 32-byte salt
$salt = random_bytes(32);

// Hash the password with the salt
$hash = argon2_hash('password', $salt, HASH_ARGON2ID);
```

The `$algorithm` can be changed by passing in either `HASH_ARGON2ID`, `HASH_ARGON2I` or `HASH_ARGON2D`. If the algorithm is invalid, an `InvalidArguementException` will be raised.

This library allows you to specify an array of options to tune Argon2 to your system. The available options for the `$options` array, and their defaults are defined above. Argon2 has several tolerances in place for each of these values. If the value falls outside those tolerances, and `InvalidArguementException` will be raised.

In the event an error occurs with the argon2 library, an `E_WARNING` will be raised, and this will return `false`.

If no errors occur, an argon2 encoded hash string will be returned.

> This function operates against version 1.3 of the Argon2 library and above.

#### Example Hash
```php
$argon2i$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=1$aUEvQlU2NTRwcHhVS0hqMg$+5h0P5YlWCJDKyZknJ0sAyqQtZjhuP1Bkw/E2It4IcE
```

> If `$raw` is set to `true`, then this function will return binary output instead. This is useful for Key Derivation Functions (KDF).

### Raw Hash Generation
```php
argon2_hash_raw(string $password, string $salt [, const $algorithm = HASH_ARGON2ID] [, array $options ] [, int $hash_len = 32 ]);
```

For applications that need raw binary output without encoding (such as key derivation), you can use the `argon2_hash_raw()` function. This function works similarly to `argon2_hash()` but always returns the raw binary hash and allows you to specify the output length.

#### Example Raw Hash Usage

```php
// Generate a secure 16-byte salt
$salt = random_bytes(16);

// Generate a raw 32-byte hash for use as an encryption key
$raw_hash = argon2_hash_raw('password', $salt, HASH_ARGON2ID);

// Generate a custom length hash (64 bytes)
$long_hash = argon2_hash_raw('password', $salt, HASH_ARGON2ID, [], 64);

// Use as an encryption key
$iv = random_bytes(16);
$encrypted = openssl_encrypt('secret data', 'aes-256-cbc', $raw_hash, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv);
```

The `$hash_len` parameter allows you to specify the desired length of the output hash in bytes. The default is 32 bytes (256 bits).

### Validating Hashes
```php
argon2_verify(string $string, string $hash);
```

Hashes can be verified by running `argon2_verify()` with the string string and string hash generated by `argon2_hash`. This function will return either `true` or `false` depending upon if the hash is valid or not. If the `hash` provided isn't a valid argon2 hash, `false` will be returned, an an `E_WARNING` will be raised.

### Retrieving Hash Information
```php
argon2_get_info(string $hash);
```

To retrieve information about an existing Argon2 hash, run `argon2_get_info()`. This function will return an array containing the algorithm name, and the options used for hash generation.

```php
array(2) {
  ["algorithm"]=>
  string(7) "argon2i"
  ["options"]=>
  array(3) {
    ["m_cost"]=>
    int(65536)
    ["t_cost"]=>
    int(3)
    ["threads"]=>
    int(1)
  }
}
```
